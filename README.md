# Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis Tool

## 🧠 Overview
This project focuses on diagnosing Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) using deep learning models trained on retinal images. It includes three progressively advanced models—starting from a traditional CNN to state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) and EfficientNetB7 architectures—to improve diagnostic accuracy and reliability.

## 🔬 Background
Diabetic Retinopathy is a serious eye condition caused by diabetes that can lead to blindness if undetected. Automated systems that analyze retinal images can assist doctors in early detection and intervention.

## 🚀 Models Used
- ✅ **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** – Initial baseline model for DR classification.
- ⚡ **EfficientNetB7** – Lightweight yet powerful CNN architecture offering superior performance.
- 🧠 **Vision Transformer (ViT)** – Uses transformer-based architecture for vision tasks, ideal for capturing complex image features.

## 🧰 Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
- **Libraries**: NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
- **Model Types**: `.h5`, `.keras`, `.pth`
